In this project we will learn how to use a module inside your class. For this we will create a class MyList and a module MyEnumerable. Our module MyEnumerable will implement a subset of the functionality of Enumerable.

<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [MyEnumerable] <a name="about-project"></a>

In this project, we delve into using modules within a class to create a MyList class and a MyEnumerable module. The purpose of the MyEnumerable module is to replicate a subset of the functionality found in the Enumerable module.


## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>
This project is built using Ruby, a dynamic, open-source programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. Ruby's elegant syntax and powerful features make it a popular choice among developers.

Visit the official [Ruby Website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) website to learn more about the language and its capabilities.

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
To begin using the Morse Code Decoder, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PabloBona/my_enumerable.git
    ```
   ```sh
   cd my_enumerable
    ```
2. Run the script to decode a New code message:

   ```sh
   ruby my_enumerable.rb
   ```

### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

This project is implemented using the Ruby programming language, known for its elegant syntax and flexibility. Ruby provides a suitable foundation for this code decoding project due to its ease of use and string manipulation capabilities.

## Usage of Ruby

Ruby is used extensively throughout the project for various tasks, including:

- Implementing the decoding algorithms.
- Creating reusable methods for character, word, and message decoding.
- Manipulating strings and performing pattern matching.
- Executing the script to NewProyects.

The project leverages Ruby's strengths to provide an efficient and user-friendly Morse code decoding solution.



### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>


- **Code Reusability:**
  To ensure clean and efficient code, the project follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Methods are designed to be reusable, reducing redundancy and promoting maintainability.

- **Flexible Adaptation:**
  The script's modular structure facilitates future expansion or customization. Additional decoding methods or enhancements can be integrated seamlessly.

<!-- FAQ (optional) -->

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

- **[What is the purpose of this project]**

  The main purpose of this project is to provide hands-on experience with using modules within a class in Ruby. It involves creating a MyList class that utilizes the functionalities defined in the MyEnumerable module, simulating a subset of the capabilities offered by the Enumerable module.

- **[What are the key methods being implemented]**

  The core methods being replicated in the MyEnumerable module are #all?, #any?, and #filter. These methods are fundamental in working with collections and determining whether certain conditions are met within them.
